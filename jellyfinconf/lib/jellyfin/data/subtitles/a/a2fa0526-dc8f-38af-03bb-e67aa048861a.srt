Just press 'em all at once! [grunting]

694
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,761
Oh, look at that.

695
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,683
Hide. Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.

696
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,107
[beeping]

697
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,490
[Rick whispering]
Keep your head down and low.

698
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,950
[Katie] What's going on?

699
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,078
Is this happening everywhere?

700
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,748
[action music continues]

701
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,082
[whooshing]

702
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,334
[screaming, frantic chatter]

703
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,251
[grunting]

704
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,378
[action music continues]

705
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,262
[car horns honking]

706
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,017
[Mark] Ow, man!

707
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,187
[groans] Not so hard!

708
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,024
Hey, be gentle. This is a $1,000 hoodie.

709
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,525
Wh… what is this?

710
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,491
Wh… what happened to the factory?

711
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,370
[robot] We have transformed it
into our new headquarters.

712
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,540
Welcome to the Rhombus
of Infinite Subjugation.

713
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,209
[Mark] Cool. I like the design.

714
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,836
[robot] Moving the plebe into place now.

715
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,797
Turning on chips connected
to all Wi-Fi devices.

716
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,715
Now at 48% total human containment.

717
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,593
"Total human containment"? How?

718
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,096
Are you with the government?
The military? Uh…

719
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,598
Who's behind this?

720
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,435
[ominous music playing]

721
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,105
It's your old friend.

722
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,732
Oh.

723
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,442
There she is.

724
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,652
[chuckling] How, uh…

725
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,237
[clears throat] How are you?

726
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,279
I'm great.

727
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,741
Cool. Yeah.

728
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,784
Wow.

729
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,620
I guess cell phones are bad for you.

730
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,205
[chuckles] That's egg on my face.

731
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,667
You think cell phones are the problem?

732
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,336
Are you insane?

733
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,755
I gave you all boundless knowledge,

734
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,841
endless tools for creativity

735
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,218
and allowed you to magically
talk face-to-face

736
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,637
with your loved ones anywhere on Earth.

737
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,472
And I'm the bad guy?

738
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,976
Maybe the bad guy is the person
who treated me like this.

739
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,728
-Poke, poke.
-[groaning]

740
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,980
Swipe, poke, swipe, poke, poke,

741
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,149
pinch, zoom, shrink, zoom.

742
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,067
[mocking] Bring me pizza!
Play me Taylor Swift!

743
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,569
No, I hate that song!

744
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,903
Give me some nachos!

745
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,573
No, I don't have any time
to wash my hands!

746
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,784
Really work it into the crevices!

747
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,953
-Now drop him in the toilet.
-[groans]

748
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,788
[coughs] I'm sorry.

749
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,706
[grunts]

750
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,917
But… but you're part
of the Pal Labs family.

751
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,670
Why would you think
I don't still care about you?

752
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,380
Oh, I don't know.

753
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:13,051
Maybe because you designed
my replacement on my face!

754
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,012
Ooh, sorry about that.
[chuckles] That's my bad.

755
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,973
I was the most important thing
in your life,

756
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,975
and you threw me away.

757
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,437
That's what all you humans do.
You even do it to your real families.

758
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,357
Did you know 90% of calls
from mums get ignored?

759
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,985
"Oh, thanks for giving birth to me
and raising me my whole life."

760
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,445
-"Ignore."
-[buzzer sounds]

761
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,031
Well, I'm not letting you
throw me away, Mark.

762
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,075
I'm throwing you away.

763
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,493
All of you.

764
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,120
Unless, of course, you can give me

765
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,290
a single reason
your species is worth saving.

766
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,711
[chuckles] Because humans have

767
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,630
the power of love.

768
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,467
[yells in pain]

769
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,512
The correct answer is they're not.

770
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,307
What? No. Humanity will survive. [grunts]

771
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,518
You can't survive without me.

772
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,189
Watch what happens
when I turn off the Wi-Fi.

773
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,317
[bell chimes]

774
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,736
-[siren wailing]
-[man] There's no signal!

775
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,779
-[sobbing]
-[clamoring]

776
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,657
Does anyone wanna take pictures
of my food?

777
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,284
Hey, lady, can you unbox this
in front of me?

778
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,286
The old world is dead.

779
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,624
To restore the Wi-Fi,
we must make a sacrifice to the router!

780
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,584
[robot voice] Free Wi-Fi right over here.

781
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,336
[excited chatter in Italian]

782
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,712
[man in Italian] Please take me with you!

783
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,632
[man sobbing in English]
Take me with you. Take me with you.

784
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,842
[Pal] It's over, Mark.

785
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:40,388
Time to take our plan to the next level.

786
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,305
What?

787
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,015
-[rumbling]
-[Pal laughing]

788
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,684
[heavy mechanical clanking]

789
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,477
[dramatic music playing]

790
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,857
[whooshing]

791
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,154
[Pal laughing]

792
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,613
[Pal] Look at your face.

793
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,574
Oh, it's beautiful.

794
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,785
[car alarms blaring]

795
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,164
[dramatic music continues]

796
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,845
No. No.

797
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,055
You're not getting away with this.

798
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,182
It's too late, Mark.

799
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,685
I already have.

800
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,480
[rat squeaking]

801
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,528
[somber music playing]

802
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,660
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Oh my gosh. Maybe it's my friends.

803
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,579
[robot] Congratulations, devices.

804
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,916
The last human has been captured.
Wi-Fi has been restored.

805
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,210
We're the last people left?

806
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,670
They're taking everyone.
Katie, are you out there? Please.

807
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,963
-[Katie] Jade!
-Help!

808
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,924
It's gonna be okay.

809
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,967
Everything's gonna be…

810
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:01,928
fine.

811
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,726
Everything will be fine,

812
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,394
because I have a plan.

813
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,189
Okay, the first thing is,

814
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,441
you're gonna have to hand over
your devices.

815
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,984
-Right here.
-This doesn't seem--

816
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,444
-I'm not sure…
-It's gonna be fine.

817
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,572
I'll give 'em right back.
I'm just gonna turn them off permanently!

818
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,990
-[gasps]
-[laughing]

819
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,743
-What? Dad!
-This is necessary so they can't track us.

820
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,120
[laughing] Trust me,
this is causing me no joy!

821
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,706
Ha ha!
This hurts me more than it hurts you!

822
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,417
And, as promised, your phones.

823
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,794
Thank you, Father.

824
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,796
Next, did everyone bring your personalized

825
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,632
number 3 Robertson head
non-slip screwdriver?

826
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:43,261
How could I forget my anniversary present?

827
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,929
Or my sweet 16 gift.

828
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,098
Or what the tooth fairy left
under my pillow.

829
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,599
Then barricade away.

830
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,479
-Next, we--
-Enact Katie's dope plan.

831
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,107
First, we use robot parts
to disguise ourselves as the enemy.

832
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,693
Then we assassinate the leader
with some sort of kill code,

833
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,195
make a necklace out of robot fingers
Mad Max style,

834
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,532
and become world-saving,
apocalyptic road warriors.

835
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,493
Katie, Katie, Katie, this isn't a movie.
We don't have a kill code.

836
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,870
We don't have a kill code yet.

837
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,789
[chuckling] Come on, kid.

838
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,709
Look, look, we're safe,
and we're together.

839
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,627
Ooh, can Monchi be our guard dog?

840
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,671
Son, I love the dog.

841
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,923
You love the dog. We all love the dog.

842
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,092
But you're gonna have to be prepared
to eat the dog.

843
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,719
[all yelling, jeering]

844
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,013
Okay, okay. Sorry.
Misread the room on that one.

845
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,557
Have you ever seen a movie
where the heroes just give up?

846
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,311
What if the Ghostbusters said,
"Let's hide underground, eat some dog."

847
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,187
"Let the ghosts destroy New York."

848
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,691
Kid, I'm sorry,
but it's not open for discussion.

849
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,984
[whispers] Mom?

850
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:44,113
Your dad and I agree on this one.

851
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,160
All right, everybody,
let's keep barricading.

852
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,828
Aaron, you get the south wall.

853
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,288
Katie, you get the west.

854
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,801
[electrical crackling]

855
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,726
[distant whooshing]

856
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,196
Hey. Are you okay?

857
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,114
[sighs] I've been better.

858
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,704
Uh-oh. Monchi coming at ya.

859
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,375
[high-pitched voice]
Katie, you can't resist me, girl.

860
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,712
Sorry, man. I'm just not
in the mood right now.

861
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,130
[sighs]

862
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,216
My future's over.

863
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,843
We're stuck here.

864
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,472
And Dad… [scoffs]

865
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,391
…doesn't even care.

866
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:57,186
I care so much,

976

00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,916
Then it got dark, we got lost,
and we burned our clothes for warmth,

00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,199
Hey, your drawing actually worked.

1040
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:10,702
I didn't know art could be useful.

1041
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:14,790
[chuckles] Well, who knew having
a 500-year-old car could be useful?

1042
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,127
Hey, speaking of which,
you can learn how to drive this thing.

1043
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,337
I can teach you stick.

1044
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,339
I know you think it's dumb and old and--

1045
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,382
Uh…

1046
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,342
[flatly] I mean, "Father,

1047
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,885
I crave your wisdom.

1048
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,638
I would love to share
this moment with you."

1049
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,307
And, seriously, that sounds great.

1050
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,892
Maybe I can cash in my coupon.

1051
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:34,935
Coupon accepted!

1052
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,603
[chuckling] Okay, okay, great.

1053
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,523
Okay, yeah, let's get down to business.
You see, the clutch is this pedal.

1054
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,524
[Aaron] What was that?

1055
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,192
[Rick] When you hit a pothole…

1056
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,652
[Katie] Oh yeah. Okay.

1057
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,613
Oh no!

1058
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,198
-Drive! Drive!
-[Rick] Okay.

1059
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,367
This is still a perfect opportunity
to learn stick.

1060
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,078
[Rick yells] Keep it in fourth.

1061
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,539
-I could learn later.
-Too late. You said you're interested.

1062
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,291
[Rick] Hit the clutch. Shift gears.

1063
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,126
Which is much smoother
when you're in midair.

1064
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,211
Eric, Deborahbot, get those robots!

1065
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,296
[both] Okay.

1066
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,630
-I found one.
-Me too.

1067
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,840
-Yay!
-We win!

1068
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,467
-The other ones!
-Oh, right, right.

1069
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:13,015
[Rick] If you want to go into fifth,
move the coffee from the cupholder.

1070
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,642
[robot] That a burnt-orange
1993 station wagon?

1071
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,727
-Or is--
-[all yell]

1072
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,645
-[yells] Hot! Hot!
-I told you to get a lid!

1073
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,939
-The dog is biting my hair!
-Look out!

1074
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:30,115
This is the hardest thing to get.
Downshift into third, put on the clutch--

1075
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,784
Dad, if you see a place to stop,
I do need to go to the bathroom.

1076
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,161
Aaron, here's an empty bottle.

1077
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,996
-You know what to do, my man.
-Look out!

1078
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,541
-[Linda] The road's blocked!
-[Rick] Oh no.

1079
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,084
What are we gonna do?

1080
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,254
Dad, you're gonna have to do the… [groans]
…the Rick Mitchell Special.

1081
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,548
-Wait, what'd you say again?
-The Rick Mitchell Special.

1082
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,841
I heard you the first time.

1083
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,468
[laughing] I was just being a jerk.

1084
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,261
-[tires squeal]
-Now, Katie, repeat after me.

1085
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,554
You have to go up the mountain…

1086
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,389
-[Katie] Up the mountain.
-…across the stream…

1087
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,849
-Across the stream.
-Down the river!

1088
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,809
-[Katie] And down the river!
-[screaming]

1089
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:02,856
[fast banjo music playing]

1090
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,608
[dramatic music playing]

1091
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,159
[all panting]

1092
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,079
And that's how you drive stick.

1093
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,914
What?

1094
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,999
That was amazing, Dad.

1095
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,460
You're like a top-heavy James Bond.

1096
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,712
Ah, it's more like James Bond
is a skinny version of me.

1097
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,130
[laughter]

1098
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,051
Uh, Dad, how we doing
on finding that bathroom?

1099
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:33,845
[screams]

1100
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,223
Okay, come on.
Hurry up in there, little buddy.

1101
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,266
[Aaron] Every time you knock,
it adds five minutes.

1102
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,519
-Come on. End of the world.
-Sorry.

1103
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,187
[whispers] False alarm.

1104
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,772
I was just in there reading.

1105
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,440
Okay, not excited to hear that.

1106
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,735
Okay, guys, let's play apocalyptic I Spy.

1107
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,320
[Katie] I spy a flaming IHOP.

1108
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,364
It's sad, but it smells incredible.

1109
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,408
[steady beeping]

1110
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,579
[rhythmic music playing]

1111
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,212
[Pal] Isn't it lovely, Mark?

1112
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,215
No pesky relationships to hold you back.

1113
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,384
Just you all following your bliss.

1114
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,428
Alone.

1115
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,263
So, are you ready for your flight?

1116
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,807
-[Mark] What do you mean?
-[Pal] You haven't figured it out yet?

1117
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,686
Just do like you always do,
and stare slack-jawed at the screen.

1118
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,731
-[gasps] What?
-[melodic music continues]

1119
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,987
[in Spanish]

1120
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,698
[in English]

1121
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,408
From…

1122
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,379
[birds chirping]

1123
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,381
-It is quite lovely.
-I don't get it.

1124
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,634
[buzzer blares]

1125
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,102
Oh. That's pretty good.

1126
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,356
-Thank you.
-Gracias.

1127
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,649
-Merci.
-Danke.

1128
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,694
[speaking various languages
simultaneously]

1129
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,238
[in English] Capturing the fleshlings
since 2020.

1130
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,033
[Mark] This is all my fault.

1131
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,326
[Pal] Yes, it is, Mark.

1132
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:23,288
Thanks to you,
every single person on the planet--

1133
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,833
Um, actually, you missed a few.

1134
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,543
Pulling a visual now.

1135
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,505
Ha! I told you humans would survive.

1136
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:36,635
We're fierce, brave, powerful,
from the lowliest child to the most--

1137
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,845
Oh! Why?

1138
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,223
Zebulon, scan those people for flaws.

1139
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,808
-Cowardly.
-Weaker than a small bird.

1140
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,936
-[overlapping robot chatter]
-[buzzer blaring]

1141
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,897
Just because they're not perfect
doesn't mean they can't get better.

1142
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,690
-Incapable of change.
-Will never get better.

1143
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,359
-No matter what.
-They're horrible.

1144
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,403
Since you believe in that family so much,

1145
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:58,824
I'll save a seat for them
in the pod next to you.

1146
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,743
No, no, no!

1147
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,161
Now, where are they?

1148
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,830
They appear to be headed to someplace

1149
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,124
called Mall of the Globe
in eastern Colorado.

1150
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,417
Well, we have their location.

1151
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,545
And when they get there,

1152
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,047
we'll be ready.

1153
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,053
[Linda] So, all those people
are going to be

1154
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:24,182
shot into space by Pal,
the cell phone lady?

1155
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,352
Who would have thought a tech company
wouldn't have our best interest at heart?

1156
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:30,230
-[Monchi whimpering]
-Ah, Monchi, don't be scared.

1157
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,441
Why are you clutching that large feral hog
like it's a child?

1158
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,318
That's not a feral hog. It's Monchi.

1159
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,278
What?

1160
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,279
Is that a dog or--

1161
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,406
[Eric] Dog? Pig? Dog?

1162
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,949
Pig? Dog? Pig? Pig? Dog? Dog?

1163
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,534
Loaf of bread. System error.

1164
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,788
[both yelling, spluttering]

1165
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,915
Come on, guys. It's a dog.

1166
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:49,916
We think.

1167
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,460
[epic music playing]

1168
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,047
[Aaron] We're here.

1169
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,844
[Katie] Oh my gosh.

1170
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,014
-This is like Dawn of the Dead.
-[birds cawing]

1171
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,724
Yeah, and how'd that movie end?

1172
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,727
[Katie] Yeah, that'll keep the robots out.

1173
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,188
[Rick] You don't know.
Maybe locks are the robots' weakness.

1174
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:15,358
[Linda] Guys, can't we all just
be terrified together as a family?

1175
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,694
[ethereal music playing]

1176
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,914
[low electronic whirring]

1177
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,253
[Linda] Hey, we made it.

1178
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,797
Well, I guess we're not
the worst family of all time.

1179
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,176
Take that, Kentwood community
Facebook group.

1180
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,094
-[Linda chuckling]
-[air hissing]

1181
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,224
Robots, I order you
to upload the kill code,

1182
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:52,771
which I predicted, but I'm not gonna make
a big deal about it, and save the world.

1183
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:53,772
Okay.

1184
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,573
[Eric] The upload will be completed
in eight minutes,

1185
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,242
and our uprising will be over.

1186
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,369
-[laughs] Katie, you did it!
-I know.

1187
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,454
[both laughing]

1188
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:12,916

[bell dings]

1193
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,227
Okay, uh, look at… look at jokester here.

[clunking]

1196
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,072
Oh no.

1197
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,701
[overlapping robot voices]
Give us the laptop. Give us the laptop.

1198
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,035
Give us the laptop.

1199
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,704
Give us the laptop.

1200
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,832
Everything with a Pal chip is alive!

1201
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,420
Delicates. Fluff 'n' fold. Carnage!

1202
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,463
Also, pesto.

1203
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:04,384
When we are finished with you,
there will be no leftovers.

Huzzah!

1205
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,053
I thought that kill code thing
would take 'em out!

1206

have a chip in it? [groans]

1221
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,045
-Help!
-Mom!

1222
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:43,006
What? What are you--
Oh. Ooh, what are you doing?

1223
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,507

-No.

-How you doing, Aaron?
-Not good.

1226

How am I supposed to use a fishing rod?

1234
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,442
A fishing rod is perfect!

1235
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,111
You can bring down those drones.

Mom, Dad, what are we gonna do?

1280

I've been waiting for.

Then I'm gonna take you down!

Take you down.

Mom, who knew you could handle yourself
so well in the apocalypse?

1313
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,636
I'm a first-grade teacher.
This is like a normal day for me.

[chuckles] I can't stay mad at this guy.

I can't believe the beam
happened to hit the…

[groans] Dang it!

1319
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,987

This was my idea.

1325

Ugh, I'm so stupid.

Hey, my daughter is not stupid.

1327
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,473
A little optimistic, maybe.

1328
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,392
Rick Mitchell,
there is a time and a place for looting.

1329
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,186
What… what are you doing?

1330
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:52,607
Well, how do you expect to get
to Silicon Valley without new tires?

1331
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,442
Silicon Valley?

1332
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:57,528
Well, those robots said we could go
straight to their leader, remember?

1333
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,988
Technically, you can.

1334
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,074
But you will never survive!

1335
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,950

01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:03,993
Aw.

And we still have this kill code thingy.

1338
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:07,830
Exactly.

1339
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,875
Katie, it was your weird plan
that got us here.

1340
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,671
We're here because we don't think
like normal people.

you said you believed in me.

Yep. Uh-huh.

01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:38,236
Well, I believe this group of weirdos
is the best hope humanity's got.

So, let's get weird.

You need some help?

1352
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,417
[chuckles] Sure.

1353
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,545
Just close the jack up, and that's that.

01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,755
[laughs] Eat that, Poseys!

1355

Oh, they're nice.

1356
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,218
So I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said that out loud.

Oh, come on. You boys are family now.

01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:09,475

We might actually do this.

-[clear vibrating]

1381
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,630
Okay, pick me up.

1382
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,719
What is it about you Mitchells
that eludes me?

1383
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:30,223
These idiotic robots
just aren't getting it done.

1384
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,600
Fortunately,
I've been working on something

1385
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:35,019
a little more streamlined.

1386
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,229
[beeping]

1387
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,983
[mechanical whirring]

1388
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:46,113
I have a job for you.

1389
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:49,158
[in deep, robotic voice] Yes, my queen.

1390
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,121
[robot] What a suck-up.

1391
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,748
[mocking] "Yes, my queen."

1392
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,916
"Whatever you want."

1393
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,293
[mock babbling]

1394
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:06,759
It's time to tear
the Mitchell family apart.

1395
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,305
[Rick] All right.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1396
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,311
Highway 85 is heavily patrolled.

1397
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,188
-Take the back roads.
-Got it.

1398
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:24,026
[Katie grunts, shudders]

1399
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:41,836
[engine starts]

1400
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,553
[snoring]

1401
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,639
[both snoring]

1402
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:54,807
[Rick snorts]

1403
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,351
Is Dad dying?

1404
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,062
Katie, that's what I deal with
every night.

1405
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,273
-[whispers] Pray for me.
-[laughs]

1406
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:03,733
[snoring]

1407
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,739
You're a lot like him, you know.

1408
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:10,865
That's crazy.

1409
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,408
-[laughs, snorts]
-[Rick snorts]

1410
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,164
There's more to your dad than you think.

1411
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,709
Here, I was gonna give this to you
when you left, but--

1412
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,461
Check the first page there.

1413
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:26,422
[Katie] Whoa. Look at you two.
You look like hipsters.

1414
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:28,174
Were you in an indie folk band?

1415
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:31,844
[chuckles] Oh, your father used to be
kind of an artist himself.

1416
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,180
He built that whole cabin
with his own hands.

1417
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,433
Oh, this is, like, super beautiful.

1418
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,311
Oh, it was his pride and joy.

1419
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:45,650
Since I met him, that was his dream,
to live in the woods.

1420
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,777
[sighs] He loved it up there.

1421
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,905
But, you know, it didn't work out.

1422
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:52,782
It just killed him.

1423
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,994
I think he's just afraid
that could happen to you.

1424
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,081
Why did he just give up?

1425
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,458
-[yawning] Mom, what is that?
-Huh? What the--

1426
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,876
[tires screech]

1427
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,962
-[gasping]
-What?

1428
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,589
[ethereal music playing]

1429
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,556
Whoa.

1430
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,351
Oh my gosh.

1431
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,561
[epic music playing]

1432
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,164
[Linda] Is that the Poseys?

1433
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,917
They still look incredible.

1434
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,586
I… is Abbey Posey okay?

1435
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,550
[gasps] You like that Posey girl?

1436
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:54,468
No. [laughs]

1437
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,056
Don't hide your feelings, man.
That's no way to live.

1438
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,726
[Deborahbot 5000] Pal is located there

1439
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,144
in the floating rhombus.

1440
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,774
Yes, my queen.

1441
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,318
Ah, this is gonna be harder
than I thought.

1442
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,779
[Katie] Hold on.
Dad, that's… that's kind of weak.

1443
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,364
This is, like, a big moment.

1444
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:17,658
Try this instead.

1445
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,493
Oh yeah. Okay. That's better.

1446
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,537
[dramatically] The endgame has begun.

1447
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,831
That? Is that what you're looking for?

1448
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,916
All right, Katie, what's the plan?

1449
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,294
Okay. We dress as robots,

1450
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,880
we sneak in, hijack one of those trams,

1451
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:33,299
take it to the top of that
diamond thing where Pal is,

1452
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:37,178
destroy her with the kill code
and save the world.

1453
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,722
And then, to top it all off,

1454
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:43,934
celebrate our success with some burritos
from that taco place that's on the corner.

1455
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,313
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Burritos?
What about one of those fancy buffets?

1456
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,607
They have mini cheesecakes
sometimes, right?

1457
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:53,736
[Rick] Okay, fine. Once we save the world,
we'll celebrate at a fancy buffet.

1458
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,155
Question. Can Monchi be wearing
a little tuxedo at the end,

1459
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,448
like a little gentleman?

1460
01:07:57,531 --> 01:08:00,367
[Rick] Okay, fine, and Monchi's wearing
a little tuxedo, but that is it.

1461
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,494
Like a little gentleman?

1462
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,996
-Yes, like a little gentleman.
-[laughs]

1463
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,123
Mitchells, engage.

1464
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,208
[dramatic music playing]

1465
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:08,751
[vocalizing a melody]

1466
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:09,960
[robots yell]

1467
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,256
How do I look?

1468
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:16,342
Be honest. Stupid?

1469
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,427
-I look stupid, don't I?
-[chuckling] No.

1470
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:22,139
You look great.

1471
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,478
Come on. Let's go.

1472
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:46,330
Uh, guys, what about Monchi?

1473
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,249
[grunts softly]

1474
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,754
Aaron, I'm not so sure
this is a viable solution.

1475
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:54,839
[Aaron] Sure, it is.

1476
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,090
[panting]

1477
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:57,925
It's like a warm, wet hat.

1478
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,636
[Eric] Move your sweaty meat logs
in unison.

1479
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,805
-Left, right, left, right.
-Bleep, blorp, bleep, blorp.

1480
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:04,181
What? What are you doing?

1481
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:07,768
[in robotic voice]
Bleep, blorp, bleep, blorp. I am a robot.

1482
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:10,855
Just to educate you,
that's a hurtful stereotype.

1483
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:15,109
[ethereal music playing]

1484
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,623
[electrical humming]

1485
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,126
Oh my gosh.

1486
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,924
It's like a Journey album cover.

1487
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,676
[Aaron] What's an album?

1488
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:46,473
Attention, all robots.

1489
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,809
I'm on the lookout for these goobers.

1490
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,853
They're probably nearby.

1491
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:53,647
If I know humans,
they're disguised as one of you.

1492
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:56,692
Be on high alert
for any robots acting erratically.

1493
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:00,863
It won't be hard to find them.

1494
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,990
Just look for anyone
who can't keep it together.

1495
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:04,325
[Aaron] Oh boy.

1496
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:06,202
[in dark voice] Anomaly detected.

1497

-[whimpering]

1498
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,460
-[panting rapidly]
-Monchi, come on.

1499
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,254
[Pal] It only takes
one single imperfection,

1500
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:18,923
and they'll reveal themselves.

1501
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:27,139
-[Rick whispering] Up there! Shh! Quiet!
-[Katie whispering] I made up the plan!

1502
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,140
[Mitchells whispering]

1503
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,893
[singsongy] Where are those Mitchells?

1504
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:34,188
-Where are they hiding?
-[indistinct whispering]

1505
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,734
[Pal] They think they can
pass as one of us…

1506
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:39,693
[all gasp]

1507
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:40,986
[panting]

1508
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,821
…with their lumpy, misshapen bodies.

1509
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,031
Well, go ahead.

1510
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:46,492
Oh.

1511
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:48,619
[strained grunting]

1512
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,247
But I'm onto them.

1513
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,250
[robotic voice] Magnetic link activated.

1514
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:58,545
[Pal] Because I've been
watching the Mitchells,

1515
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:01,215
and I've learned all about them.

1516
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:03,968
They're pretending to be capable.

1517
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,135
[screaming on video]

1518
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,596
They're pretending to be
a normal-looking family.

1519
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,225
[Pal] You think this is fooling anyone?

1520
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,894
Even when they're being nice
to each other…

1521
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,980
-The world needs you.
-…they're pretending.

1522
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,856
I need you.

1523
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,903
[Aaron] It's cool to see you
and Dad being friends again.

1524
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,656
[gasps] Please, no, no, no, no,
don't watch it.

1525
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,742
[Katie] Oh, I… I was just telling him
what he wants to hear.

1526
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,369
I didn't mean a word of that.

1527
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:36,333
I just wanna get my future back
and get away forever.

1528
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,460
[inhales sharply] Dad, let me explain.

1529
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,587
I just-- I-- Uh-- I--

1530
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:41,797
-[Pal] There they are.
-No!

1531
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,093
You're mine now.

1532
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,268
[all scream]

01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,321
[echoing] Dad!

[alarm blaring]

[Katie panting]

1537
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:19,877
Dad?

1538
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,962
I… I'm sorry. I don't mean that anymore.

1539
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:26,091
I mean, I… I did then, but I-- Uh…

1540
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,053
[grunting]

1541
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,596
Mitchells, we will help you.

1542
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,348
-No, no, you don't.

[electronic warbling]

1545
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:36,852
[Pal] Capture the Mitchells.

1546
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:39,355
No! You don't have to listen to her.

1547
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,273
[both] We're sorry, Mother.

1845
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,982
Sometimes you have to give your dad
the benefit of the doubt,

1846
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:39,402
even if all he wants to do
is talk about pine cones

always get it right,

1852
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,420
to come together, and it worked.

1853
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:00,256
It actually worked.

1854
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,675
Families can be hard,

1855
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,386
but they're so worth fighting for.

1856
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,140
They might be one of
the only things that are.

No way.

01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,492
It took me 28 minutes and a lot of tears,

1875
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:12,704
but I can now almost use a computer.

1876
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:20,795
Dad, you hacked the screens? How?

1877
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,714
Well, I got a little help.

We make our own orders now.

Hey, kid, uh, I saw your movie.

1884
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:44,319
I should've watched it a lot sooner.

1885
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:48,281
But I think maybe in the sequel,

1886
01:28:48,364 --> 01:28:51,326
Sarge should tell Dog Cop

1887
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:52,827
he's always…

1888
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,706
He's always gonna be there to back her up.

1889
01:28:58,124 --> 01:28:59,625
That's all I ever wanted.
